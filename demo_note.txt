API Integration Assignment - Demo Note

1. API/Payment Gateway Chosen:
- Cashfree Payment Gateway (Sandbox environment)
- Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In)

2. Data Flow (input → process → output):
- User visits the app and signs in using Google (Firebase Auth).
- On the /checkout page, user enters (pre-filled)payment details (amount, name, email, phone).
- When "Pay Now" is clicked:
    - Frontend sends a POST request to `/api/createOrder` with payment details.
    - Backend API route (`app/api/createOrder/route.js`) creates a Cashfree order using credentials from environment variables.
    - Cashfree returns a `payment_session_id`.
    - Frontend receives the session ID and launches the Cashfree Drop-in Checkout using the SDK.
    - User completes payment in the Cashfree UI.
    - Success/failure is shown in the UI.

3. Challenges Faced & Solutions:
- **Cashfree SDK not loading:**
    - Solution: Used Next.js `<Script>` component with `strategy="afterInteractive"` for reliable client-side loading.
- **Duplicate order ID errors:**
    - Solution: Generate a unique order ID for every payment attempt.
- **Environment variable issues:**
    - Solution: Documented required variables in README and checked for presence in backend API.

The demo runs end-to-end: user authentication, payment initiation, backend order creation, Cashfree UI, and result display. Minimal UI is provided for clarity and ease of testing.
